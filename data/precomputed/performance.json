      "key_metric": "4.7% engagement rate with 4,200 conversions",
      "insight": "Carousel posts drove highest saves and shares (2.3x average). Reels outperformed static posts on reach but carousels had higher conversion rates. Influencer takeover stories generated 3x normal story views.",
      "recommendation": "Increase carousel frequency by 20% in Phase 2. Test shoppable Reels for direct conversion."

      "insight": "The #DrinkSwap challenge went semi-viral with 280+ UGC submissions. Creator partnerships with micro-influencers (10K-50K) outperformed mid-tier creators on engagement by 2.1x. Best posting time: 6-9 PM weekdays.",

      "recommendation": "Reduce Twitter/X budget by 50% and reallocate to TikTok and Instagram. Shift to community management focus only — respond, don't broadcast."
